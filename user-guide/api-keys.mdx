## API Key Management

Each API key gets its own wallet for isolated budgets.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to **API Keys** page
2. Click **"Create New API Key"**
3. Give it a name
4. Copy and save the key (shown only once!)

### Using Your API Key

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chat402.xyz/api/v1/prompt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","prompt":"Hello!"}'
```

See the [Developer Guide](/developer/quickstart) for more examples.
