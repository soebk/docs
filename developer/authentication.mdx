## API Key Authentication

All API requests require an API key in the Authorization header.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Visit [chat402.xyz](https://www.chat402.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Go to **API Keys** page
4. Click **"Create New API Key"**
5. Copy and save the key (starts with `pp_`)

### Using Your API Key

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer pp_1234567890abcdef...
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chat402.xyz/api/v1/prompt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","prompt":"Hello!"}'
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secret! Anyone with your key can use your balance.
